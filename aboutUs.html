    A stationery shop is a retail store specializing in products like paper, pens, notebooks, and other <br>
    office supplies. It often stocks items for school, work, and art, catering to students,<br>
     professionals, and hobbyists alike. Common products include pencils, markers, binders,<br>
      planners, and sometimes specialty items like fountain pens or high-quality <br>
      sketchbooks. Many stationery shops also offer gift cards, greeting cards, and <br>
       wrapping materials, making them a go-to for personalized gifts and creative <br>
        supplies. Modern shops may incorporate eco-friendly products, such as <br>
         recycled paper and refillable pens, appealing to environmentally conscious <br>
          customers. They provide a tactile, creative shopping experience. <br>
